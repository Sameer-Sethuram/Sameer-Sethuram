My name is Sameer Sethuram, and I am a computer science major at the Stevens Institute of Technology who is also, by chance, an aspiring machine learning engineer. If I had to describe myself using a few terms, I think logical, perceptive, honest, and analytical might be a few good ones, but in order to determine that for yourself, my friends would probably say you'd have to meet me.

## Tech Stack
Some of the things that I am proficient in are Java, Javascript, C, C++, Python, SSH, Linux/Bash, Assembly, Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, and a couple other things that I can't think of at the moment.
Although I can employ these skills, the things that I actually like happen to be Python (specifically working with Jupyter Notebooks) as well as C and Java if I'm having a good day, but mostly just Python related things. Python's simplicity entices me, while it's depth and complexity encourage me, and I have had quite a bit of fun playing around with different libraries like scikit learn, seaborn, pandas, numpy, and keras.<br>
I think that one library I would like to get into more would be keras becuase during my time at Break Through Tech AI and Machine Learning Fundamentals and Applications, I was able to witness the power and complexity of deep learning through the classification of handwritten numbers. Learning about convoluted neural networks and seeing how well they performed shocked me, and if possible, I would love to delve deep into this topic!

## Key Projects
### Electronic Clipboard (Favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è)
I've done many different kinds of programming projects since I was a freshman in highschool, but I think out of all of them, the one I am most proud of is the Electronic Clipboard that I created and designed in my senior year of high school with the help of my mentor, Mr. McDonald. I think what makes me proud of this project over the others is that I had the opportunity to broaden my horizons and think like an inventor. To this day, it is one of the very few phyical projects I've had (where I had to construct something in real life), and although the result includes a wooden framework that will give you splinters everytime you use it, I am proud of myself for making it work. You can check out the repository on my github, though you won't be able to really do much with what I have on it because of the physical aspect.
### Bankruptcy Prediction Model (Relevant üôå)
Another one of the projects that I'm really proud of is perhaps the most relevant one to my career path. During my spring semester of my second year at Stevens, I had the privelege to work in a group of 4 (shoutout to Ryan Hu, Xiaotong Feng, and Prutha Trivedi for their stellar work) on a bankruptcy prediction model that employed the use of machine learning to predict whether a company would go bankrupt based on historical data. Doing this project with my group gave me an immense amount of hands on experience that I don't think I will find much more through the rest of my college years, and what I mean by this is that this project opened my eyes to the beauty of machine learning. From VIF filtering to PCA analysis, the ingenuity of mankind has never been brighter to me than in the few weeks that we worked on this project, and we ended up placing 4th out of the entire class for our performance. Looking back on this project now that I have some more experience with machine learning, we definitely should've reduced the feature size of each cluster that we worked on by a lot. That way, we probably would've placed even higher in the class, but this doesn't bother me becuase the amount I learned compensates for this oversight (it won't happen again). If you want to learn more about this project, you can view it on my github as well!

## My Hobbies and Interests (Get to know ME)
Aside from my professional aspirations, I also have other goals that my mind is set on.
### Competitive Speedcubing
You may have heard of this one somewhere on YouTube, but since July 11th, 2016, I have been obsessed with Rubik's Cubes. Ever since I figured out how to solve one, I've always tried to solve it faster the next time around. It got to the point where I would use my mom's IcyHot spray on my neck to dull the pain I acquired from looking down at my cube all day long (not even an exaggeration, definitely not one of my best moments). Eventually, my passion and obsession with these colorful plastic puzzles coalesced into a desire to compete as an official Rubik's Cube speedsolver. Since May 2017, I have competed in 39 of these such competitions, and during my later years as a speedcuber, I managed to win a few podium places in events like 2x2 and 3x3. If you want to know more about this, I'll have a section right below this detailing my stats.
#### STATS FOR THOSE WHO KNOW
My WCA ID is 2017SETH03 (you can type this in google and I'm the first result that pops up), and for 3x3 my PB single is 4.10 seconds, and my PB average of 5 is 6.23 seconds. Normally, I can manage to average sub 8, but it's on and off with the weather. My main at the moment is a Weilong V9 that I've had since NAC 2023 or something like that, and it has served me well. I specialize in 2x2 and 3x3 (because I don't know where all my other cubes went), but I enjoyed big cubes as well, especially 6x6 (which I think I was averaging low 2 minutes before my MGC broke üòî). Square-1 is also something I like, but all the other events aren't really to my liking (even though I'll still compete in them lol). 
My best event is probably 2x2 because I almost made finals at Nationals in 2023 (but I DNFed my 4th solve that set me back by 10 places). I used to know full CLL and EG-1, but I forgot some of the algorithms because I took a little hiatus when I got to college.

### Powerlifting
The gym started out as a futuristic goal for me, where I would end up looking super jacked and strong by the end of it, but actually became a journey instead. After trying to consistently get leaner and leaner, I instead decided to flip the script and start bulking so I could build some actual muscle, but after about a year or two of doing this, I was tired of the gym when I saw no results, so I joined the powerlifting team at Stevens to try something new, and I fell in love with powerlifting. As soon as I joined, I saw how comparably weak I was compared to all the other lifters on the team, but as I got more consistent with powerlifting, I started to see a lot of improvements in my lifts. By the end of my first year of powerlifting, I increased my total by 185 pounds, and my squat, bench, and deadlift numbers in pounds is 300, 185, and 435 respectively. Although I have one of the weakest benches known to man, I will forever blame it on by very strange proportions that make me a deadlift specialist.
