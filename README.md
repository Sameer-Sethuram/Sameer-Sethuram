# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sameer Sethuram!

🎓 **Computer Science Major @ Stevens Institute of Technology**  
🤖 **Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer**  
🧠 Logical. Perceptive. Honest. Analytical.

I'm a tech enthusiast with a growing interest in **machine learning** and **data science**. My favorite language is **Python** because its simplicity entices me, while its depth encourages me to pursue more. That said, I’m also comfortable with **Java**, **C**, and even a bit of **assembly** (if I’ve had my coffee ☕).

Whether it’s through building cool projects, lifting heavy weight at the gym, or solving Rubik’s Cubes in under five seconds, I'm always looking for new ways to push my limits.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
`Python` • `Java` • `JavaScript` • `C` • `C++` • `Assembly`

**Data Science / ML:**  
`NumPy` • `Pandas` • `scikit-learn` • `Seaborn` • `TensorFlow` • `Keras`

**Dev Tools:**  
`Jupyter Notebooks` • `Linux/Bash` • `SSH`

**Databases:**  
`SQL`

I’ve especially enjoyed working with libraries like **scikit-learn**, **Keras**, and **Seaborn**.  
Keras and TensorFlow became particularly exciting after my experience at the **Break Through Tech AI & Machine Learning Fundamentals and Applications** program, where I got hands-on with **convolutional neural networks** for handwritten digit classification. Deep learning fascinates me, and I'm eager to explore more.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### ❤️ Electronic Clipboard
One of my most memorable projects — and still my favorite.

In my senior year of high school, I built a physical “Electronic Clipboard” with the help of my mentor, *Mr. McDonald*.  
It combined programming with real-world construction (wooden frame and all), which gave me a chance to think like an inventor.

⚙️ *You can find it on my GitHub, though it’s a bit tricky to run without the physical hardware (and possibly gloves for splinters 😅).*

### 🙌 Bankruptcy Prediction Model
During Spring of my second year at Stevens, I worked on a **machine learning model** to predict company bankruptcies using financial data.  
Collaborated with an amazing team (*shoutout Ryan Hu, Xiaotong Feng, and Prutha Trivedi!*)

- Used techniques like **VIF filtering** and **PCA analysis** to reduce noise and extract meaningful features  
- Achieved **top-4 class performance**  
- In hindsight: we could’ve improved cluster feature reduction, but the learning was absolutely worth it

This project deepened my love for ML and showed me how real data requires just as much critical thinking as code does.

## ✨ Outside of Tech

### 🧩 Competitive Speedcubing

I’ve been hooked on Rubik’s Cubes since **July of 2016**, and I’ve competed in **39 official WCA competitions** since 2017.  
**WCA ID:** [2017SETH03](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017SETH03)

- ⚡ **3x3 PB:** 4.10s single, 6.23s average  
- Specialize in **2x2 and 3x3** (almost made 2x2 finals at Nationals 2023, but a DNF on my 4th solve cost me 😅)  
- Used to know full **CLL** and **EG-1**, should probably brush up on that again!  
- Currently maining: **Weilong V9 (3x3)** since NAC 2023

Cubing taught me persistence, pattern recognition, and how to stay cool under pressure. (Or at least try to.)

### 🏋️‍♂️ Powerlifting

I joined the **Stevens Powerlifting Team** as a way to shake things up—and ended up loving it.  
What started as a casual fitness goal evolved into a full-blown commitment.

**Current lifts (lbs):**  
- Squat: 300  
- Bench: 185  
- Deadlift: 435  
- Improved my total by **185 lbs in my first year**

Still working on my bench, but for now I'll stick to blaming my proportions 😅

Powerlifting taught me that strength is built in small, consistent steps—just like learning code.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

I'm actively growing my skills in **machine learning** and **data science** and looking for **internship opportunities** where I can contribute to meaningful projects and learn from industry pros.

Got any leads or interesting projects? I’d love to hear about them!
